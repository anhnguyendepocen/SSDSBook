In writing this text, I draw inspiration from the work of Donald Knuth.1 Knuth has discussed his experiences in designing new software languages, nothing that the developer of a new language …must not only be the implementer and the first large-scale user; the designer should also write the first user manual… If I had not participated fully in all these activities, literally hundreds of improvements would never have been made, because I would never have thought of them or perceived why they were important… While there is nothing particularly new about what I am writing here, and I am certainly not developing a new language for computing, the goal of this text remains similar to Knuth’s experience. By distilling some of key elements for making a successful transition to being a professional developer of knowledge rather than a casual consumer, I hope to both improve the course experience itself and also create an environment that fosters a successful learning experience for you. In both classes, the course names are deceptive. We are not only concerned with statistical work or mapping. Rather, we are more fundamentally concerned with research methods. In particular, we are concerned with high quality research methods and the process of conducting research. We therefore focus on a combination of mental habits and technical practices that make you a successful researcher. Some of the skills and techniques that we will discuss this semester are not taught as often in graduate programs, let along undergraduate program. Instead, they are often the products of “learning the hard way”. These “habits of mind and habits of method” are broadly applicable across methodologies and disciplines. Donald Knuth is the developer of TeX, a computer typesetting system that is widely used today for scientific publishing in the form of LaTeX. He also established the concept of literate programming, which forms the basis of some of the practices we follow with R.↩ "],

["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!
