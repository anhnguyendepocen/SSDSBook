["markdown.html", "Chapter 7 Markdown", " Chapter 7 Markdown Markdown is a simple markup language. Markup languages are used to give computer programs directions on how particular blocks of text should be processed. Markdown was developed in 2004 by writer and developer John Gruber. Gruber describes Markdown on his website: Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible. Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters — including Setext, atx, Textile, reStructuredText, Grutatext, and EtText — the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. To this end, Markdown’s syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation characters, which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so as to look like what they mean. E.g., asterisks around a word actually look like emphasis. Markdown lists look like, well, lists. Even blockquotes look like quoted passages of text, assuming you’ve ever used email… …Markdown’s syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a format for writing for the web. Markdown is utilized to varying degrees by many of the data science tools we’ll use in both courses, including RStudio, GitHub, and Slack. In all three applications, Markdown provides a straightforward way to format and stylize plain text files. Markdown therefore gives us the best of two worlds - text files can be organized and formatted as in WYSIWYG editors like Microsoft Word, but they remain plain text files that are accessible in a variety of computing environments and do not depend on proprietary applications.

["document-organization.html", "7.1 Document Organization", " 7.1 Document Organization There are two principle means for organizing Markdown documents - headings of varying size and paragraph breaks. 7.1.1 Headings Markdown contains six heading levels. Headings are identified with # symbols and a space that separates them from from the heading text. Input: # This is the largest heading ## This is the second largest heading ### This is the third largest heading #### This is the fourth largest heading #### This is the second smallest heading ###### This is the smallest heading Output: 7.1.2 New Paragraphs Leave a blank line between two paragraphs to create a break. Input: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Quam pellentesque nec nam aliquam sem et tortor consequat. Auctor urna nunc id cursus metus. Eleifend mi in nulla posuere. Facilisis sed odio morbi quis. Nibh nisl condimentum id venenatis. Lectus nulla at volutpat diam ut venenatis. Pretium lectus quam id leo in vitae. Neque vitae tempus quam pellentesque nec nam aliquam. Curabitur gravida arcu ac tortor. Arcu risus quis varius quam quisque id diam. Viverra aliquet eget sit amet tellus cras adipiscing. Tellus molestie nunc non blandit massa enim nec. Tempus imperdiet nulla malesuada pellentesque elit eget. Non blandit massa enim nec. Sed risus pretium quam vulputate dignissim suspendisse in est ante. Output: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Quam pellentesque nec nam aliquam sem et tortor consequat. Auctor urna nunc id cursus metus. Eleifend mi in nulla posuere. Facilisis sed odio morbi quis. Nibh nisl condimentum id venenatis.

["working-with-text.html", "7.2 Working with Text", " 7.2 Working with Text Markdown provides a number of tools for working with and stylizing text. These include options for bold and italicized text, adding code blocks, quoting text, and creating bulleted and enumerated lists. 7.2.1 Styling Text Text can be styled using bold and italics To create italicized text, wrap your text with a single asterisk *. To create bold text, wrap your text with double asterisks **. Input: *This is an italicized sentence.* **This is a bolded sentence.** Output: This is an italicized sentence. This is a bolded sentence. 7.2.2 Quoting Text Quoting text (which I have used above to illustrate examples) is done with a greater then symbol (&gt;). Input: &gt; This is quoted text. Output: This is quoted text. 7.2.3 Quoting Code There are two types of code quotes in Markdown. In-line quotes, which are included in a sentence, are wrapped in single backticks: &gt; Use the describe command to list variables in R To include code blocks, which are better for including the full syntax of particular commands and their output, use triple backticks: . describe make price mpg storage display value variable name type format label variable label -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- make str18 %-18s Make and Model price int %8.0gc Price mpg int %8.0g Mileage (mpg) Note how the word ‘Stata’ is written after the first set of triple backticks. This is an indicator for GitHub that the code is written in Stata’s programming language. By including this, GitHub can apply some syntax highlighting to your files. This makes them easier to read. 7.2.4 Links In Markdown, adding hyperlinks is a two step process. The text that you want to have hyperlinked is written first and is wrapped in brackets []. After this, you include the URL wrapped in parentheses (). This is an example of including in-line hyperlinks: The course website is hosted using the service GitHub. 7.2.5 Embedding Images Within the directory that contains your Markdown file, create a subdirectory called Output. Save all images for a particular assignment there. In your main assignment Markdown file, include a hyperlink reference: Note how, instead of including text to be hyperlinked, we suppress this aspect of the syntax by using an exclamation point !. 7.2.6 Simple Lists Bulleted lists are indicated in Markdown using the dash - or a single asterisk *: mean median mode variance standard deviation Enumerated lists are created by preceding each line with the appropriate number: calculate the mean calculate the variance calculate the standard deviation You can create more complex lists by preceding a line with two single spaces. You can also combine bulleted and enumerated lists when using this approach. "],
["github-markdown.html", "7.3 GitHub Markdown", " 7.3 GitHub Markdown These are specific to what is called GitHub Markdown - there are some subtle differences in the way GitHub uses Markdown formatting. 7.3.1 Styling Text Text can be styled using bold, italics, and strikethroughs. To create italicized text, wrap your text with a single asterisk * *. To create bold text, wrap your text with double asterisks ** **. To create strike-through text, wrap your text with two tildes ~~ ~~. This is a sentence with strikethrough text 7.3.2 Tables 7.3.3 Task Lists If you want to create task lists on GitHub, you can include brackets separated by a space before each list item [ ]. Completed tasks include an x in place of the space [x]. These task lists are interactive - when published on GitHub, you can click on the resulting checkboxes to toggle them between complete / incomplete. [x] calculate the mean [ ] calculate the variance [ ] calculate the standard deviation 7.3.4 Mentioning Other GitHub Users If you want to mention me or one of your classmates in a comment, include the @ symbol before their username: Hey (???), thanks for the feedback. I made the changes to lines 40 and 41. Once the document is uploaded to GitHub, the username will render as a hyperlink and the user will be alerted. "]
