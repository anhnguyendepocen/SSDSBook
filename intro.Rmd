# Introduction {#intro}

The first part of this text is designed to help get you oriented to coursework in computational social science. Both [Introduction to Geographic Information Science (SOC 4650/5650)](https://slu-soc5650.github.io) and [Quantitative Analysis: Applied Inferential Statistics (SOC 4930/5050)](https://slu-soc5050.github.io) are focused on building students' capacities to address social science research questions using tools that have been the traditional domain of computer and information scientists. The growth and application of these tools in a variety of disciplines both inside and outside of the social sciences has come to be known as data science. Both courses are taught from this perspective, so that while we focus on social science data, the tools and techniques are broadly applicable across disciplines. 

## What is data science?

Given data science's new emergence, its definition remains both contested and often unclear. For me, there are four key aspects to focus on when considering what constitutes data science:

1. Statistics
2. Programming
3. Visualization and Communication
4. Substantive Knowledge

I think of this as a "full stack" approach to computational research. You want to be well versed not only the techniques for generating and analyzing data, but also substantively in the academic literature about your area of interest as well as ways to communicate your findings with other researchers and the wider public.

### Statistics
Statistics covers the mathematical techniques that we use to draw inference from our data. It is the main subject of one my courses, [Quantitative Analysis](https://slu-soc5050.github.io). In [Introduction to GIS](https://slu-soc5650.github.io), we do not explicitly cover much in the way of inferential statistics. However, the course is desinged to prepare you for a next level, Intermediate GIS course that covers spatial statistics. 

### Programming
Computer programming is an essential part of data science broadly and computational social science more specifically. Using a programming language means that our work can be easily reproduced. This emphasis on **reproducibility** is a response to a growing fear in many disciplines that results are replicable from study to study, which raises questions about the validity of much of the research work that we do. Our goal in both courses is to produce research that is as reproducible as possible.

This book introduces two programming languages - [`R`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) and [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)). In [Quantitative Analysis](https://slu-soc5050.github.io), we will be focused exclusively on learning `R` and using it to produce statistical analyses. In [Introduction to GIS](https://slu-soc5650.github.io), we will spend a lot of time in `R`, but we will also use some Python to help pass data from `R` to ArcGIS, the mapping application we will use. I will also provide some additional Python lessons to folks who are interested, but these will not be required for the course.

### Visualization & Communication
Visualization is a fundamental aspect of data science work. It is how we make our results easily digestible and accessible to a wider audience, many of whom may not be able to interpret statistical output but can learn from a well-designed scatter plot. In [Quantitative Analysis](https://slu-soc5050.github.io), we will focus on building plots to communicate information about statistical distributions and the relationships between our variables. In [Introduction to GIS](https://slu-soc5650.github.io), we will use the same fundamental skills to build simple maps in `R`. We will extend our emphasis on visualization to ArcGIS, where we will focus on producing cartographically rich depictions of our data.

Separetely, we will discuss the presentation of statistical data in tables using [LaTex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) in [Quantitative Analysis](https://slu-soc5050.github.io) as well as the producing to conference-style presentations to communicate research findings. In [Introduction to GIS](https://slu-soc5650.github.io), we will focus on producing conference-style posters instead. These are different mediums, but they rely on the same design fundamentals that are covered in this text.

### Substantive Knowledge
Substantive knowledge covers two tangentially related topics: the ability to work well in groups and the ability to digest and integrate an academic literature into your own research. Each of these topics receive some focus in both [Quantitative Analysis](https://slu-soc5050.github.io) and [Introduction to GIS](https://slu-soc5650.github.io). Each class has some group work associated with the completion with weekly lab assignments. [Introduction to GIS](https://slu-soc5650.github.io) also has a group work component associated with the final project. In each class, students' final projects are focused on a specific content area that requires at least some background research and knowledge. Synthesizing this knowledge and integrating it into your final projects is a key piece of addressing this facet of data science.
