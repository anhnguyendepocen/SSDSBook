# Approaching this Course

Students have varying experiences learning statistical techniques. For some, the math and programming that are the foundation for modern statistical methods come naturally. For others, being introduced to these concepts can be an anxiety producing experience. I am fond the phrase "your mileage will vary" for describing these differences - no two students have the exact same experience taking a methods course.

## Zen and the Art of Data Analysis
One of the biggest challenges with this course can be controlling the anxiety that comes along with learning new skills. `R` synatx, LaTeX commands, and Markdown can seem like foreign alphabets at first. Debugging `R` synatx can be both challenging and a large time suck, in part because you are not yet fluent with this language. Imagine trying to proofread a document written in a language that you only know in a cursory way but where you must find minute inconsistencies like misplaced commas.

For this reason, I also think it is worth reminding you that many students in the social sciences struggle with quantitative methods at first. It is normal to find this challenging and frustrating. I find that students who can recognize when they are beginning to go around in circles are often the most successful at managing the issues that will certainly arise during this course. Recognizing the signs that you are starting to spin your wheels and taking either ten minutes, an hour or two, or a day away from statistics coursework is often a much better approach than trying to power through problems.

## An Apple a Day
Being able to walk away from an assignment for a day requires excellent time management. If you are waiting until the night before or the day of an assignment’s due day to begin it, you give yourself little room for errors. I recommend approaching this course in bite size chunks - a little each day. The most successful students do not do all of their reading, homework, and studying in a single sitting. I find that this approach not only creates unnecessary anxiety around assignments, it also dramatically limits the amount of course material you can absorb. Keep in mind that I expect the *median* student to spend approximately six hours on work for this class each week (twice the amount of in-class time).

A sample approach to the class might look something like this:

  - Monday: class
  - Tuesday: finish lab
  - Wednesday: Start problem set
  - Thursday: Finish problem set
  - Friday: First reading
  - Saturday: Second reading


## Reading with Purpose
The book and article **reading assignments** for this course are different from most of the other reading you will do in your graduate program because they are often very technical. Students who are most successful in this course read twice. Read the first time to expose yourself to the material, then take a break from the reading. During this first read, I don’t recommend trying to complete the example problems or programming examples. Focus on the *big picture* - what are the concepts and ideas that these readings introduce?

During the second read, try to focus in in the *details* - what are the technical details behind the big picture concepts? I recommend doing this second read with your computer open. Follow along with the examples and execute as much of them as you can. By using this second read through as a way to test the waters and experiment with the week’s content, you can come into the lecture better prepared to take full advantage of the class period. Students who follow this approach are able make important connections and focus on the essential details during lectures because it is their third time being exposed to the course material. They are also in a much stronger position to ask questions.

## Active Lectures and Labs
During **lectures**, I introduce many of the same topics that your readings cover. This again is intentional - it gives you yet another exposure to concepts and techniques that are central to geospatial science. One mistake students sometimes make is focusing on the details of *how* to do a particular task rather than focusing on *when* a task should be done. If you know when a task is needed but cannot remember how to do it in `R`, you can look this information up. Conversely, detailed notes on executing `R` commands may not be helpful if you are unsure when to use a particular skill. There is no penalty in this course for not knowing how to execute a command from memory; this is what reference materials are for. The most successful students will therefore focus on *when* a particular skill is warranted first before focusing on *how* to execute that skill

Getting experience with executing tasks is the purpose of the **lab exercises**. Time for beginning these exercises is given at the end of each class meeting, and replication files will be posted on GitHub for each lab.
