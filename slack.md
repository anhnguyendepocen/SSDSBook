# Slack

One of the three core areas for analysis development identified by Parker (2017) is collaboration. Data science work often occurs in teams, sometimes remotely, and building a skillset in working collaboratively from the outset is important. This chapter will not focus on the soft skills required for working as part of a team. Rather, we'll focus on some of the technical tools that are useful for facilitating this work.

At its core, Slack is a messaging tool designed to keep people in touch with one another.
